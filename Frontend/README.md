## Getting Started

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and build.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. We recommend using the latest LTS version.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

### Running the Development Server

Start the Vite development server with:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build, run:

```sh
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

### Previewing the Production Build

To preview the production build locally:

```sh
npm run preview
# or
yarn preview
# or
pnpm preview
```

This will start a local static server to serve the built files.
